**Project: Global Plastic Pollution Analysis**

**Objective:**
The "Global Plastic Pollution Analysis" project aims to analyze and understand the trends and patterns of plastic pollution worldwide. By leveraging data on various features such as Entity, Code, Year, Per capita plastic waste (kg/person/day), GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $), Total population (Gapminder, HYDE & UN), and Continent, the project seeks to provide insights into the extent of plastic pollution across different regions and its correlation with economic and demographic factors.

**Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Collected comprehensive data on plastic waste, GDP, population, and other relevant features from reliable sources.
   - Conducted data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Derived additional features such as GDP per capita, population density, and plastic waste per capita from the raw data.
   - Standardized and normalized the data for consistency and comparability across different regions.

**Modeling and Analysis:**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted EDA to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within the data.
   - Analyzed the relationship between plastic waste generation, economic development, and population dynamics.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized Seaborn, Matplotlib, and other visualization libraries to create insightful plots, charts, and graphs.
   - Visualized the distribution of plastic waste, GDP, and population across continents and over time.

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
1. **Data Processing and Storage:**
   - Processed and transformed the analyzed data into a structured format suitable for storage and further analysis.
   - Stored the processed data in a secure and accessible database for future use.

**Insights and Metrics:**
1. **Plastic Pollution Metrics:**
   - Calculated key metrics such as per capita plastic waste generation, GDP per capita, and population density for each region and year.
   - Analyzed trends and variations in plastic pollution levels across different continents and over time.

2. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Investigated the correlation between plastic waste generation and economic indicators such as GDP per capita and PPP.
   - Examined the impact of population growth and urbanization on plastic pollution trends.

**Conclusion:**
The "Global Plastic Pollution Analysis" project provides valuable insights into the magnitude and dynamics of plastic pollution on a global scale. By combining data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling techniques, the project offers a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving plastic waste generation and its implications for environmental sustainability. The findings can inform policymakers, environmentalists, and stakeholders in developing strategies to mitigate plastic pollution and promote sustainable waste management practices worldwide.
